# TUI Puzzles
A collection of small puzzles to play on the command line.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and `cd` into the top-level directory.
```sh
cmake -B build
cd build
make
make test
```
Once you have built the project, the `build`  directory should contain an executable for each puzzle.
